This project emulates three different types of bank accounts checking, savings, and a trust account. The user can interact with these accounts through a menu that has the options of display, add, delete, and find an account as well as deposit and withdraw. This project uses C++ object oriented programming and polymorphism. The three account types were made using a base class called accounts.
